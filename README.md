# WineTerm

Market intelligence for the wine industry. Prices, production, stocks,
trade and crop intelligence for wineries, growers and the global wine
trade, with a focus on the professional European market (Spain and
Portugal first, comparative data for France and Italy).

## Stack

- Next.js (App Router) with React Server Components
- TypeScript in strict mode
- Tailwind CSS 4 (tokens defined in `src/app/globals.css`)
- Recharts for charts, wrapped in `ChartFrame` so the library is swappable
- next/font: Newsreader (editorial serif), Archivo (interface sans),
  IBM Plex Mono (data)

## Structure

```
src/
  app/               Routes: interim home, /briefing, /design-system (internal)
  components/
    layout/          Global shell: header, navigation, footer, breadcrumbs
    ui/              Section headers, buttons, filters, tabs, labels, states
    market/          Tables, price cells, changes, charts, commentary
    editorial/       Article previews, newsletter modules
  lib/               Navigation config and formatting helpers
  services/          Typed service layer (fixture-backed for now)
  fixtures/          Illustrative sample data only; see fixtures/README.md
```

The service interfaces in `src/services` are the seam for real data
sources, authentication and a database later; components depend only on
those interfaces. Nothing in `src/fixtures` is real market data.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # development server
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm run build      # production build
```

`/design-system` documents the tokens and component set. It is excluded
from the sitemap and marked noindex.

## Environment

- `SITE_URL`: canonical origin, including the scheme, used for
  `metadataBase`, the sitemap and robots.txt. Optional: without it,
  Vercel builds use the project's production domain and local builds
  use `http://localhost:3000`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`:
  the Supabase project. With both set, the forms store briefing signups
  and contact messages; without them, submissions are discarded and the
  reply says so.
- `SITE_INDEXABLE`: set to `true` to let search engines index the site.
  Until then every page is marked noindex, because the figures are
  illustrative fixtures.

## Database

Supabase project `wineterm`, in Paris (`eu-west-3`). Schema changes live
in `supabase/migrations` and are applied in order;
`src/lib/database.types.ts` is generated from the schema and must be
regenerated after each migration.

The site talks to the Data API with the publishable key, which runs as
the `anon` role. Grants and row level security limit that role to
inserting form submissions, which it can never read back, and to reading
market data. New tables get no grants by default, so each migration
grants exactly what a table needs.
